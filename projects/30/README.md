# Project 30: Federated Learning and Machine Learning to power integrated diagnostics of breast cancer 

## Abstract


Participants will be challenged to create the most accurate possible machine learning solution to diagnose breast cancer, combining the provided dataset, including histopathology data. 

As we also want to illustrate the application of Federated Learning in healthcare, the hackathon will rely on the FL software developed by Owkin, Owkin Connect, running on AWS. We will use publicly available histo-genomic datasets, that we will prepare to simulate a Federated Learning setup. Through the HealthChain consortium, Owkin already showed the impact of Federated Learning to accelerate medical research. We established that ML models can be trained successfully with Owkin Connect on histology images, siloed at different clinical centers, to predict treatment responses in breast cancer.
