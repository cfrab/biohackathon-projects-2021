# Project 30: Federated Learning and Machine Learning to power integrated diagnostics of leukemias and lymphomas

## Abstract

The correct and comprehensive diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas is a basic prerequisite for choosing the best possible therapy. The Torsten Haferlach Leukemia Diagnostics Foundation is involved in leukemia research and to improve the infrastructure, the foundation also supports the establishment of institutions dealing with routine diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas.

For decades flow cytometry data was interpreted manually through a process called gating. This was time consuming, based on the experience of the user and potentially error prone. Lately AI methods were applied to interpret RAW Flow cytometry data, involving the generation of images, which are fed into Pattern recognition algorithms, which works fine - but not perfect! We theorize, that using the raw data (aligned in value matrix) rather than converting it into an image prior inserting into an AI algorithm could be faster and more sensitive.
The goal of this project is to take raw flow cytometry data and predict the diagnostics results without image conversion.

Participants in this challenge will be challenged to create the most accurate possible ML solution to diagnose leukemia and lymphomas, combining the provided dataset, including genomic data, phenotypic information and imaging data.
Owkin will provide its solution for federated learning, running on AWS
